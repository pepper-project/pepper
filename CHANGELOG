Version 2.3 (078fb0725bbfc91134781382de203a916117faf6), August 6 2014
  + Move TinyRAM implementation to an independent git project
  + create submodule reference to TinyRAM impl

Version 2.2 (77ac7ebd0e86c9027112ead934e22916f79a4367), July 25 2014
  + This commit fixes a bug found by the authors of TrueSet (Proceedings
  of Usenix Security 2014) whom we thank: Ahmed E. Kosba, Dimitrios
  Papadopoulos, Charalampos Papamanthou, Mahmoud F. Sayed, Elaine Shi,
  and Nikos Triandopoulos.

  Changes:
    + Use the naive switch-case solution to implement RAM operations
    when that solution is cheaper than Merkle-tree based solution

    + Add two new APIs: ramget_hybrid() and ramput_hybrid() that
    automatically switch between the naive solution and the Merkle tree
    based solution using a flag in pepper/flags, DB_THR_NUM_ADDRESSES_NAIVE 

    + Add examples to exercise the new API: apps_sfdl/ram_hybrid_micro.c
    and apps_sfdl/ram_merkle_micro.c
